# minimalist-typography


Create a webpage with the following specifications:

Font and Typography:

Use the "Bebas Neue" font for all text on the page.
Page Layout:

The home page should have a clean, minimalist design with a white background.
At the top, centered horizontally, place a navigation menu with the following items: "ABOUT ME," "TIPOGRAF√çA," "S√çNTESIS VISUAL," "DIBUJO," and a stylized "[Z]¬≥" on the far right.
The navigation menu items should be spaced evenly and use the Bebas Neue font in black color.
Hover Effect:

When a user hovers over any of the navigation menu items, change the text color to "Mexican Pink" (Hex color code: #E4007C).
Central Graphic:

In the center of the page, place an image of round eyeglasses.
The eyeglasses should be positioned between two square brackets. The left bracket should be placed before the left lens, and the right bracket should be placed after the right lens.
To the right of the right bracket, place a superscript "3" to denote a cubed symbol, making it look like "[ ]¬≥" with the eyeglasses in between the brackets.
Menu Item Interaction:

The "[Z]¬≥" menu item should be styled similarly to the other menu items, with the same hover effect changing the color to Mexican Pink.
